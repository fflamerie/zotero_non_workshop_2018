# Bibliographic and PDF management tools : overview and practical focus on Zotero

Non-content of a non-workhop for [CEE2018](https://cee2018.sciencesconf.org) "From knowledge to environmental action : synthesising evidence to inform decisions" . The workshop was planned but had to be cancelled.

It has been designed as a component of a larger project, [CEE Biblio management project](https://osf.io/3a9zy), which aimed to provide an overview of the usage and usability of reference management softwares for systematic review within the CEE, as well as to improve bilbiographic-related practices among CEE members.

It has been prepared with the contributions of Ludivine Boursier (Foundation for Research on Biodiversity - Scientific documentalist and secretary) and Alison Bethel (University of Exeter - Information Specialist).

## Description of the workshop
Bibliographic management is understood in a broad sense, to include the management of bibliographic references and full-text files. The teaching is designed in two stages :

*  A time of restitution and exchanges (1h) around the results of a survey on bibliographic management practices within the CEE (online survey carried out from Frebuary 2018),
* A practical training time (2h) to open source software Zotero, centered on the most useful functionalities in the context of a systematic review, such as :
    * Tools to organize and share the library
    * Management of all types of documents and files
    * Exports and bibliographic writing
