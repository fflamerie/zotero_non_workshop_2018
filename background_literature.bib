The fewest mistakes were detected in references generated by Zotero for 11 journals and the NLM style, while the second fewest number of mistakes was found in Mendeley. The largest number of mistakes for 9 journals was found in references generated by EndNote and in the other 4 journals the largest number of mistakes was detected in RefWorks references. With regard to the individual types of resources, the lowest number of mistakes was shown by Zotero, while RefWorks had the greatest number of mistakes. All programs had problems especially with generating the URL and the date of access in the reference to online documents. It was also found that several mistakes were caused by technical limitations of the reference managers, while other mistakes originated due to incorrect setting of the citation styles. A comparison showed that Zotero and Mendeley are the most suitable managers.},

This time-consuming task leads to wasted resources. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of a newly developed deduplication program against EndNote.},

  abstract = {Background: Bibliographic database software is often recommended as a tool that can assist researchers in managing the large numbers of references produced in early stages of a systematic review. The uses of such software in systematic review research are often represented solely in terms of bibliographic functions, while the uses that extend beyond simple bibliographic functions have not been explored.Aims: This article provides a guide on how to use extended functions of bibliographic software to systematically complete the steps of appraising search results and coding references for inclusion in or exclusion from the systematic review.Methods: The process is illustrated using an ongoing systematic review as a case description and using screenshots from the bibliographic database, EndNote\textregistered, the authors' preferred software program for the study.Results: The case description illustrates how bibliographic software serves not only to organize and store search results, but also to appraise and code search results and to explicitly track researchers' decisions across the systematic review.Conclusion: Bibliographic tools can contribute to make the methods that researchers adopt for the phase following the initial literature search more transparent and systematic. The illustrative case description involves a systematic review of academic education in occupational therapy, but easily generalizes to systematic reviews in other health science professions.},

  abstract = {Background: A number of software tools are being developed to support systematic reviewers within the software engineering domain. However, at present, we are not sure which aspects of the review process can most usefully be supported by such tools or what characteristics of the tools are most important to reviewers. Aim: The aim of the study is to explore the scope and practice of tool support for systematic reviewers in other disciplines. Method: Researchers with experience of performing systematic reviews in Healthcare and the Social Sciences were surveyed. Qualitative data was collected through semi-structured interviews and data analysis followed an inductive approach. Results: 13 interviews were carried out. 21 software tools categorised into one of seven types were identified. Reference managers were the most commonly mentioned tools. Features considered particularly important by participants were support for multiple users, support for data extraction and support for tool maintenance. The features and importance levels identified by participants were compared with those proposed for tools to support systematic reviews in software engineering. Conclusions: Many problems faced by systematic reviewers in other disciplines are similar to those faced in software engineering. There is general consensus across domains that improved tools are needed.},

  abstract = {Background
Reference management software programs enable researchers to more easily organize and manage large volumes of references typically identified during the production of systematic reviews. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which authors are using reference management software to produce systematic reviews; identify which programs are used most frequently and rate their ease of use; and assess the degree to which software usage is documented in published studies.Methods
We reviewed the full text of systematic reviews published in core clinical journals indexed in ACP Journal Club from 2008 to November 2011 to determine the extent to which reference management software usage is reported in published reviews. We surveyed corresponding authors to verify and supplement information in published reports, and gather frequency and ease-of-use data on individual reference management programs.Results
Of the 78 researchers who responded to our survey, 79.5\% reported that they had used a reference management software package to prepare their review. Of these, 4.8\% reported this usage in their published studies. EndNote, Reference Manager, and RefWorks were the programs of choice for more than 98\% of authors who used this software. Comments with respect to ease-of-use issues focused on the integration of this software with other programs and computer interfaces, and the sharing of reference databases among researchers.Conclusions
Despite underreporting of use, reference management software is frequently adopted by authors of systematic reviews. The transparency, reproducibility and quality of systematic reviews may be enhanced through increased reporting of reference management software usage.},

  doi = {10.1108/RSR-06-2017-0024},
  abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this study was to determine faculty preferences and attitudes regarding reference management software (RMS) to improve the library's support and training programs. Design/methodology/approach - A short, online survey was emailed to approximately 272 faculty. Findings - Survey results indicated that multiple RMS were in use, with faculty preferring Zotero over the library-supported RefWorks. More than 40 per cent did not use any RMS. Research limitations/implications - The relatively short length of the survey precluded a more detailed investigation of faculty attitudes. The 20 per cent response rate, although typical of surveys of this type, may over-represent those faculty who have strong attitudes toward RMS. These findings support the necessity of doing more research to establish the parameters of the RMS environment among faculty, with implications for support, instruction and outreach at the institutional level. Practical implications - Surveys should be conducted to establish local faculty RMS usage and preferences, as they may differ from both published findings and local expectations. Because it is unlikely that faculty will overwhelmingly use one RMS, libraries should plan to support multiple RMS. Originality/value - This study is among the first to investigate the issue of RMS faculty preferences in a liberal arts setting.},

  abstract = {Reference management software (RMS) is the most important aspect that is essential for all levels of researchers. They are established as research tools to help scholars in organising their work, improving workflows, and ultimately saving time. Choosing an appropriate RMS for managing records and utilising the bibliographic citation has been a challenge among researchers. They always seek for the features of an appropriate RMS prior to making an investment to buy the software. In this paper, a fuzzy logic approach is adopted for assessing the features of RMS from the researchers' perspectives. Accordingly, a web-based survey was conducted and data collected from the researchers who had experience with different types of RMS. Then, we analyse the effects of RMS features on researcher perception in selecting an appropriate reference management program and find the importance level of those features. This study provides a toolset for RMS developers to identify the importance level of RMS features and accordingly consider these important features in developing the next generation of citation management software.},

Findings indicate participants adopt tools because of an expectation of enhanced research productivity, but participants persist in using the tools because of ease-of-use experiences. Librarians were found to have opportunities to influence tool adoption decisions but may have somewhat less influence over researchers' decisions to continue using bibliographic management tools.},

While there are studies examining the reference management practices of academics and students, the practices of those not using RMS have remained largely unexplored. This article reports on the findings of a small-scale applied research project aimed at understanding the reference management practices of postgraduate students and academics in the Arts Faculty at Monash University. A questionnaire was completed by 81 students and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 8 students and 13 academics in the Faculty. Analysis shows that the reference management practices detailed in this study are individual and personal, and do not always involve the use of RMS. The reasons for adopting these practices are informed by a wide range of institutional and personal factors. RMS use itself is also varied, with few of the interviewees utilising all the core features of the software. A broader approach to reference management instruction and support would increase the relevance of library instruction.},

Even though they are seen as the ``gold standard'' when synthesising primary research, systematic reviews and maps are typically resource-intensive and complex activities. Thus, managing the conduct and reporting of such reviews can become a time consuming and challenging task. This paper introduces the open access online tool CADIMA, which was developed through a collaboration between the Julius K{\"u}hn-Institut and the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence, in order to increase the efficiency of the evidence synthesis process and facilitate reporting of all activities to maximise methodological rigour. Furthermore, we analyse how CADIMA compares with other available tools by providing a comprehensive summary of existing software designed for the purposes of systematic review management. We show that CADIMA is the only available open access tool that is designed to: (1) assist throughout the systematic review/map process; (2) be suited to reviews broader than medical sciences; (3) allow for offline data extraction; and, (4) support working as a review team.},

  abstract = {As library discovery and delivery has largely moved online, the scholarly
workflow of academic researchers has become increasingly fragmented.
Faculty are using a variety of software solutions to find, retrieve, organize,
annotate, cite, and share information, including library resources. This
article discusses the significance of situating discovery, the act of finding
new information, within software central to the research workflow, such as
citation management software. The current status of discovery of library
resources within citation management software is outlined, along with
expected future developments. Utilizing findings from two Mellon funded
studies, it explores the challenges users face in managing their individual
scholarly workflows, and recommends optimizations designed to mitigate
information loss and increase researcher productivity.},

  abstract = {Research outputs across the academic disciplines are almost exclusively published electronically. Organizing and managing these digital resources for purposes of review, and with the technical savvy to do so, are now essential skills for graduate study and life in academia. Paradoxically, digital and web-based technologies provide greater ease and efficiency with which to gather mass amounts of information, while at the same time presenting new challenges for reading, analyzing, organizing, and storing resources. Students, scholars, and the librarians who support them must adopt and refine practices to convert from paper-full to paperless literature review. This article proposes a methodical, reproducible, three-stage process that harnesses the power digital tools bring to the research cycle, regardless of the user's preferred platform or operating system. Focusing just on the literature review phase, we develop a conceptual framework, illustrated with concrete tips and advice for storing and organizing, reading and annotating, and analyzing and writing. We demonstrate how a researcher's self-selected suite of tools may be used to complement and even overcome the limitations of comprehensive academic literature and composition platforms such as Docear and F1000Workspace, especially regarding qualitative data analysis software for analyzing and coding research literature. Using these techniques, librarians can become teachers and research partners supporting the skill development of faculty and students.},
